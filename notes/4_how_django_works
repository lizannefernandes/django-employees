MVT
Model
View 
Template
Design pattern = way of defining the rules of developing software applications

Explanation for the MVT Diagram

MVT Responisble for each and every db operation
template is the user facing pattern
model can talk to db
view is bridge that tells the model that i need something from the db
model gives view data and then it passes to template then the user can see it

User accesses the application using URLS
Checks the url patterns in urls.py
if requested url exists it will go to the corresponding view where it has the function 
eg path('profile/', views.profile)
it goes to views.profile this fn contains the logic for what to do with the request, it says get the fname and lname from the db
model gives the data back to view if it exists
from the view we pass the data to the template and the user can see it
