🐍 What Is Django?
Django is a high-level web framework written in Python that helps you build websites and web applications quickly and efficiently.
💡 Think of it like this:
If building a website were like building a house, Django would be your toolkit—complete with blueprints, power tools, and ready-made parts to speed up construction.

🚀 Why Use Django?
- Fast Development: You can go from idea to finished product quickly.
- Secure: Helps protect your site from common threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- Scalable: Used by big companies like Instagram and Pinterest.
- Batteries Included: Comes with built-in features like user authentication, admin panel, and database management.
