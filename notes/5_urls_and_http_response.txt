source venv/Scripts/activte -->in bash terminal in vscode

python manage.py runserver

http://127.0.0.1:8000/home

create endpoint
go to urls.py
add  path('home/', views.home)

NameError: name 'views' is not defined

create views.py in mysite
 from . import views

create one function inside views

from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello Word')

now if u go back here http://127.0.0.1:8000/,  u dont have anything

remove home and keep it blanks, which means home page, which will be blank, when u put empty string it means that after http://127.0.0.1:8000/'' we dont have anything

    path('', views.home)


def home(request):
    return HttpResponse('This is our homepage')

if we try to load all the html tags for our webpage inside the html HttpResponse, we will never be able to manage this FullyQualifiedErrorId

That's where the template comes in 

instead of using the HttpResponse we will render the template

How to render the TEMPLATE?
create a new folder called templates in the root
inside this create a file called home.html
and put this in it <h3>This is our homepage</h3>

update the views.py that we had created earlier to print the home page contents
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')

configure in setting.py
go to TEMPLATES -->DIRS 
pass the foldername

'DIRS': ['templates'],
1. home function will be called inside urls
2. inside home fn we render the html which is inside templates/home.html
3. and we have the html inside home.html
