Go to mysite>views.py

we need the list of emp stored int he db
the emp are stored in the Employee class
so go inside employee table
employees = Employee.objects.all()

and from employees.models import Employee

lets print this employees variable
print(employees)

refresh the home page on the browser and the home function will run

<QuerySet [<Employee: Lizanne Fernandes>, <Employee: Sheriff Brown>]>

now to print on the front end

we send them emp to home.html because that is what is printing the html content

make use of context dictionary and put the emp inside the contenxt dict as the key 

context = {
    'employees':employees,
}
pass the context inside the home.html
    return render(request, 'home.html', context)when we pass context to the html template
    we will have the access to this empoloyees context we are passing and it will be available inside home.html

go to templates>home.html
{{ employees }} //print the employees data

template tags
are a way of telling django that here comes something else then a plain html
fi we have plain html we simply write the html tags
but what if u wanna write some python code or the logic inside the html template

    {% for i in employees %}
        <!-- {{ i }} -->
        <h4>{{ i }}</h4>
    {% endfor %}
that's when we use these template tags
in this eg we want to loop through some data
sometimes we want to put an if else condition
we can use these template tags {{% %}}
{{}} template variable
they are used to print the python variables inside the html template

clear the last 2 rows

update
                <tr>
                <th scope="col">#</th>
                <th scope="col">Full Name</th>
                <th scope="col">Designation</th>
                <th scope="col">Phone Number</th>
                </tr>

loop through data and print it
                {% for emp in employees %}
                <tr>
                <th>{{forloop.counter}}</th> autogenerated by django db
                <td>{{emp.first_name}} {{emp.last_name}}</td>
                <td>{{emp.designation}}</td>
                <td>{{emp.phone_number}}</td>
                </tr>
                {% endfor %}


now we add one more employee on the browserand then delete teh second employeeif we check the home page again we sometimesthe emp id
now is
1
3
since this is frm the db pk
<th>{{forloop.counter}}</th>
