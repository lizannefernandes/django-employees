store data in db --on thispage will be storing 
write some logic to fetch that data
show it in the front end

DATABASE

in settings.py
db.sqlite3

to create tables and fields we use models.py
employees>models.py

class Employee(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    photo= models.ImageField(upload_to='images')
    designation = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email_address = models.EmailField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=12, blank=True) #bank=True to make optional
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) #auto_now_add --one time modification when it is created and saved for the first time
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) # whenever u need a feld to change the instance is saved with current time when inntance is modified

when model is created now u need to migrate them, that is add the new field in the db

add our app name in settings.py --make sure

pillow is a package thatt is used to manage the img files in the django application

django.core.management.base.SystemCheckError: SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:

ERRORS:
employees.Employee.photo: (fields.E210) Cannot use ImageField because Pillow is not installed.
        HINT: Get Pillow at https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/ or run command "python -m pip install Pillow".  

python -m pip install Pillow

To create the database tables we need to create two commands

one is the 
python manage.py makemigrations
an other one is 
python manage.py migrate

run this -->python manage.py makemigrations
it will read read models.py
what this command dose is that it look for changes and modifications any newly created classes
and it create a migration file

so inside employees>migrations>0001_initial.py -- this generated swl

and when we run python manage.py migrate it will execute that sql
Applying employees.0001_initial... OK

now start the server
python manage.py runserver

now hit the url
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

still no changes are reflected

so go employees>admin.py
and register the emp models
from .models import Employee
# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Employee)

now refresh the site

now the changes are reflected

now the employee is added
but the employee hyperlink has to be edited to reflect fname and lname
and the image also hyperlink is not working

so this has to be fixed

------
images folder was created in root

to load media files in the browser we have a special config

create folder named media in the root folder
delete the images folder which was created when we upload the photo 
photo= models.ImageField(upload_to='images')

then we go to settings.py

go to bottom of the file

#Media files configuration
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR /'media'

Now go to urls.py and call the static fn , to serve files uploaded by a user during development
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/static-files/

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static


+ static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

after adding this
go to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
go to employees

and then open the existing employee 
and then reupload the image since we deleted the previous from images folder

http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/liz_pp.jpeg
now its loading correctly
if u see now an images folder has been created in the media folder

now fixing Employee object (1)

that's why we will put the string representation of the model

def __str__(self):
    return(self.firstname+" "+self.lastname)
